During our collaborative and brainstorming sessions, we recognized and valued the unique talents of each team member, aiming to select a project that would be captivating for everyone. This led us to collectively decide to build a front-end application, enabling each team member to actively engage in its development.

Using "Budget Busters: New Year, New Numbers" theme, we developed an application that enables users to enhance their expense tracking. Through forexample, a chart generated from the data that the user inputs, this allows the user to visually compare the distribution of their salary or income across various expenditures.

### Future Features

- #### Convert Currency
  - Once the user has used the calculator their will have they option to automatically convert all figures to a different currency. As we did not have the time to add this functionality on the finished app, we decided to add a separate currency convertor bellow the calculators.

- #### Link your Banking App
  - Users have the option to link their banking app and every time they make a transaction it is automatically added to their Buckets Breakdown. This makes it easier for users to keep a track of all speedings without having to manually enter it.
